- Exhibit understanding of existing literature around your topics (30%)
    - You will share your screen showing LitMaps results.
- Clear research question (25%)
    - Do you understand the topic you selected?
    - Were you able to articulate it as a research question?
- Preview/outline of what you plan to do to answer that question. (25%)
- Fit & finish (20%)
    - Visual aides should be clear, concise, and not too wordy.
    - Speaking style should slow and understandable.
