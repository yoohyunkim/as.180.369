This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors driving changes in total government spending on welfare programs, integrating both economic and non-economic determinants. 
By delving beyond traditional economic analyses, we explore how political dynamics and societal perceptions significantly influence welfare expenditures. 
Our research involves an extensive literature review and rigorous regression analyses comparing welfare spending with variables such as the governing political party, public opinion trends, and key economic metrics. 
We further examine the consequential effects of these spending changes on macroeconomic outcomes like poverty rates, unemployment levels, and overall economic growth. 
The findings reveal that political control and public sentiment play a pivotal role in shaping welfare policies, often outweighing purely economic considerations. 
These shifts have profound implications for macroeconomic trends, impacting poverty reduction, employment rates, and GDP growth. 
This study underscores the necessity for policymakers to consider both economic and non-economic factors in formulating effective welfare policies aimed at achieving desired socio-economic outcomes. 
By highlighting the interplay between politics, public perception, and economic realities, our research contributes valuable insights to the discourse on welfare policy development.
