This paper investigates the factors influencing changes in total government spending on welfare programs by examining both economic and non-economic determinants. 
Our research aims to determine whether adjustments in welfare expenditures are shaped by elements beyond rational economic analysis, such as political dynamics and societal perceptions, and to assess the impact of these spending changes on macroeconomic outcomes. 
We conduct a comprehensive literature review on how non-economic factors affect welfare policies independently of economic indicators. 
Additionally, we perform regression analyses comparing welfare spending with variables like the governing political party, public opinion trends, and key economic metrics. 
We then examine the subsequent effects on poverty rates, unemployment levels, and overall economic growth. 
Our findings reveal that shifts in welfare spending are significantly influenced by political control and public sentiment rather than solely by economic necessity. 
These changes have substantial implications for macroeconomic trends, impacting poverty reduction, employment rates, and GDP growth. 
The study underscores the importance of considering both economic and non-economic factors in the formulation of welfare policies to achieve desired socio-economic outcomes.
