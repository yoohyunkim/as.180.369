This paper investigates the factors driving changes in total government spending on welfare programs through a dual-faceted approach. 
First, we explore whether adjustments in welfare expenditures are influenced by elements beyond rational economic analysis. 
This involves reviewing literature on how political dynamics and societal perceptions shape welfare policies independently of economic indicators.
Second, we assess the impact of these spending changes on macroeconomic outcomes. 
We perform regression analyses comparing welfare spending with variables such as the governing political party, public opinion trends, and key economic metrics. 
Additionally, we examine the subsequent effects on poverty rates, unemployment levels, and overall economic growth. 
Our findings reveal that shifts in welfare spending are often significantly affected by political control and public sentiment rather than solely by economic necessity.
These changes, in turn, have substantial implications for macroeconomic trends, influencing factors like poverty reduction, employment rates, and GDP growth. 
The study underscores the importance of considering both economic and non-economic factors in the formulation of welfare policies.
