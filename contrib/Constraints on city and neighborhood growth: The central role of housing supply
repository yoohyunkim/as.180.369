//paragraph for Constraints on city and neighborhood growth: The central role of housing supply

  Constraints on city and neighborhood growth, particularly the role of housing supply, play a significant role in shaping urban development patterns. 
Limited supply often drives up prices, making homes less affordable and contributing to issues like economic displacement and gentrification. 
Research could examine how housing shortages impact affordability across cities through econometric models.
Additionally, restrictions on housing supply can limit urban density, affecting transportation, public services, and infrastructure, prompting studies on how housing policies influence city planning and resource allocation. 
Zoning laws and regulatory barriers also play a central role in limiting development, and research could investigate how reforms might unlock more housing opportunities and promote equitable neighborhood growth. 
These topics offer opportunities for both qualitative and quantitative analysis, including policy studies, case comparisons, and simulations of housing market responses to regulatory changes.
