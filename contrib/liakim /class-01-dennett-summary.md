Reaction to Dennett's Article on Counterfeit People and AI
In his thought-provoking article, Dennett argues that counterfeit people are among the most threatening artifacts in human history. He presents counterfeiting not just as a minor offense but as a serious crime with profound implications for society. Through various examples, Dennett illustrates how counterfeiting undermines trust, threatens economies, and poses significant risks to human freedom.

Historical Context of Counterfeiting

Dennett begins by exploring the historical context of counterfeiting money. He points out that for several thousand years, the act of counterfeiting currency has been recognized as a severe crime, often punishable by capital punishment. This harsh response underscores the fundamental role that trust plays in the functioning of societies and economies. Without trust in the authenticity of money, the very foundation of economic transactions collapses, leading to widespread instability.

The Emergence of Counterfeit Digital People

Transitioning from traditional counterfeiting, Dennett argues that the creation of counterfeit digital people represents the most dangerous form of counterfeiting in history. Unlike fake money, counterfeit digital individuals pose threats not only to economies but also to human freedom. Dennett references Alan Turing’s 1950 proposal, which laid the groundwork for developing high-tech products capable of deceiving individuals into believing they are interacting with real people. This technological advancement opens the door to widespread deception, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit individuals.

Erosion of Trust and Social Consequences

One of the most alarming consequences Dennett highlights is the erosion of trust. Counterfeit digital people can severely impact personal relationships and the functioning of democracy by making it challenging to identify who is real and who is not. This uncertainty undermines social interactions and the very fabric of society, as trust is a cornerstone of meaningful relationships and effective governance. The inability to distinguish between real and counterfeit individuals can lead to paranoia, social fragmentation, and a general decline in societal cohesion.

Comparisons to Nuclear Weapons and Proposed Solutions

Dennett draws a stark comparison between the risks posed by counterfeit digital people and those of nuclear weapons. He emphasizes that counterfeit entities have the potential to reproduce uncontrollably, leading to catastrophic consequences. To mitigate these risks, Dennett suggests implementing high-tech watermark systems akin to those used in currency protection. These systems could help detect and prevent the creation of counterfeit digital people. Additionally, he advocates for strict penalties for those who create or distribute counterfeit AI, reinforcing the seriousness of the offense and deterring potential offenders.

Call to Action for the AI Community

In his conclusion, Dennett calls on the AI community to recognize their moral obligations. He urges AI developers to avoid actions that could jeopardize humanity's future freedom, emphasizing that creating counterfeit people is a deeply antisocial act deserving of strong legal deterrents. Dennett's call to action serves as a reminder that with great technological power comes great responsibility, and it is imperative for those involved in AI development to prioritize ethical considerations to safeguard human rights and societal trust.

Personal Reflection

I found Dennett’s article to be a compelling exploration of the severe problems posed by artificial intelligence, particularly concerning human rights. AI was initially envisioned as a tool to aid humanity and enhance our lives, but Dennett highlights its potential to become something sinister—creating fake people that seamlessly integrate into our digital spaces. This transformation represents not just a technological advancement but a direct assault on our freedom and humanity. The erosion of trust caused by AI-generated counterfeit individuals is both heartbreaking and infuriating, making it nearly impossible to distinguish between what is real and what is fabricated.

In Korea, we are already witnessing the devastating impact of deepfake technology, which is being used to violate individuals in the most intimate and degrading ways. The ability to fabricate videos or audio recordings to ruin someone's life is horrifying and constitutes a blatant disrespect for human dignity and the value of personal work. This issue transcends technology gone wrong; it is about losing control over our identities and personal narratives.

AI must be held accountable for the chaos and harm it is causing. Developers have a responsibility to consider the consequences of their creations, and stricter regulations are essential to prevent the further erosion of human rights. Protecting society from the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence requires a concerted effort to enforce ethical standards and legal deterrents against the creation and distribution of counterfeit AI.
