# Reaction to Dennett Article 

  I loved how this article pointed out the severe problem of artificial intelligence, explicitly mentioning human's right. 
AI was supposed to be a tool to help humanity, to elevate our lives, but now it’s morphing into something sinister, creating fake people who can seamlessly blend into our digital spaces. This isn’t just a technological advancement; it’s a direct assault on our freedom and our humanity. It’s heartbreaking and infuriating to see how these AI-generated counterfeit people are eroding trust, confusing us, and making it nearly impossible to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. 
  Here in Korea, we’re already witnessing the devastating impact of deepfake technology, which is being used to violate individuals in the most intimate and degrading ways. The very idea that someone could fabricate a video or audio of you, using it to ruin your life, is nothing short of horrifying. It’s a blatant disrespect for the value of human work and dignity. This isn’t just about technology gone wrong—it’s about losing control over our own identities, our own stories. 
  AI should be held accountable for the chaos and harm it’s causing.  AI developers must be held accountable for the consequences of their creations, and stricter regulations are essential to prevent the further erosion of human rights and to protect society from the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence.
