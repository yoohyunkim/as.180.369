# Reaction to Dennett Article 
	This article argues that counterfeit people are among the most threatening artifacts in human history. It presents counterfeiting as a serious crime through several examples. First, the author mentions the historical context of counterfeiting money. The text notes that counterfeiting money has been recognized as a serious crime for several thousand years, often warranting capital punishment because it undermines the trust on which society depends. Furthermore, the text argues that the creation of counterfeit digital people is the most dangerous form of counterfeiting in history. These counterfeit people threaten not only economies but also human freedom. Additionally, the text references Alan Turing’s 1950 proposal, which led to the development of a high-tech industry focused on creating products that can trick people into believing they are interacting with real individuals. This illustrates how the pursuit of AI has led to the potential for widespread deception. The text also emphasizes that counterfeit people could lead to the erosion of trust, with severe implications for personal relationships and the functioning of democracy. It highlights the difficulty of distinguishing between real and counterfeit individuals, which could undermine social interactions. Furthermore, the text compares the risk posed by counterfeit people to that of nuclear weapons, noting that these counterfeit entities can reproduce, potentially leading to uncontrollable consequences. The text suggests implementing high-tech watermark systems similar to those used in currency protection to detect and prevent counterfeit digital people. It argues for strict penalties for those who create or distribute counterfeit AI. In conclusion, the text calls on the AI community to recognize their moral obligations and avoid actions that could jeopardize the future freedom of humanity. It implies that creating counterfeit people is a deeply antisocial act that should be met with strong legal deterrents.

	I loved how this article pointed out the severe problem of artificial intelligence, explicitly mentioning human rights. AI was supposed to be a tool to help humanity, to elevate our lives, but now it’s morphing into something sinister, creating fake people who can seamlessly blend into our digital spaces. This isn’t just a technological advancement; it’s a direct assault on our freedom and our humanity. It’s heartbreaking and infuriating to see how these AI-generated counterfeit people are eroding trust, confusing us, and making it nearly impossible to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. Here in Korea, we’re already witnessing the devastating impact of deepfake technology, which is being used to violate individuals in the most intimate and degrading ways. The very idea that someone could fabricate a video or audio of you, using it to ruin your life, is nothing short of horrifying. It’s a blatant disrespect for the value of human work and dignity. This isn’t just about technology gone wrong—it’s about losing control over our own identities, our own stories. AI should be held accountable for the chaos and harm it’s causing. AI developers must be held accountable for the consequences of their creations, and stricter regulations are essential to prevent the further erosion of human rights and to protect society from the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence.
