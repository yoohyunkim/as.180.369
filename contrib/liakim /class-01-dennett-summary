# Reaction to Dennett Article 

I loved how this article pointed out the severe problem of artificial intelligence, explicitly mentioning human's right. 
I believe since artificial intelligence is made to help human but the way they are 
I agree that creating fake people who can pass for real in a digital environment threatens human freedom. 
They are distracting and confusing people, and it is getting harder to tell if humans or AI make them.
It is disrespecting the values of human work. AI should be held accountable for the risks as AI could potentially threaten the human civilization even more.
The penalties should be stronger because more and more AI communities are seeking for new opportunities to use their power that they are 
ignoring moral obligation.
